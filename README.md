# DigiVault
Welcome to DigiVault, a digital time-capsule technology that allows users to upload any form of media, choose a date, and receive it in the future.

Our project utilizes a Flask backend with a Linux database to store our files and user data.

# How To Set Up
Setting up the DigiVault repository is quite easy. We utilize VSC for this, with git integration for development.
1. Download GIT for your computer
2. Copy the HTTP link and integrate

After adding this, file management should be quite easy. Every file we have in this project should be able to run without installing any additional items, other than maybe a Python compiler.

# File Managements
Our files are dispersed in many different folders, which are self-explanatory.

For example, CSS files are in the css folder, and so on.

# Current Implementations
As of now, our product allows the following:
- User account creation
- User account deletion
- User upload files
- Receiving files
We have the base functionalities present for this, but we have much more that we'd like to implement.

# Future Implementations
We plan on adding the following to our project:
- One-week buffer to edit uploaded content
- Multiple recipient option
